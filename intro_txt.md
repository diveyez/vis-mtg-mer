We present a data set for the analysis of personalized Music Emotion Recognition (MER) systems.
We developed the [Music Enthusiasts platform](https://ilde.upf.edu/trompa/) aiming to improve the gathering and analysis of the so-called “ground truth” needed as input to such systems.
Our data set is publicly available and we invite researchers to use it for testing MER systems.

**You can choose the music selection on the legend of the plot**: double-click on the legend to visualize only that selection, and double-click again to visualize all selections. *Opacity depends on the amount of annotators.*
